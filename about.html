<p class ="overview"> Welcome to my personal portfolio website. My name is Kathy, and I'm excited to share with you a showcase of my work and the creative journey I'm on. As a student at Simon Fraser University, I'm in the midst of completing a double major that bridges the technical and the artistic â€” Computer Science with a focus on Computer Graphics and Multimedia & AI, paired with Interactive Arts and Technology, concentrating on Interactive Systems.
<br><br>
With a solid foundation in computer science, I've gained a deep understanding of the mechanics behind computer graphics. This encompasses everything from the mathematical underpinnings of simulations to the nuanced artistry of rendering. The knowledge I've acquired allows me to not only appreciate the complexity of visual effects but also to contribute to their creation with expertise.
<br><br>
I am diligently working toward a career in post-production and visual effects, a field where storytelling meets the pinnacle of current technology. Here, within the pages of my portfolio, you'll find a variety of projects that reflect my skills and growth. These range from detailed 3D models and animations to immersive interactive experiences, each project a step in my ongoing quest to push the boundaries of what's possible.
<br><br>
Through my studies in Interactive Arts and Technology, I've developed a keen eye for designing experiences that captivate and engage. Whether it's through the seamless integration of user interfaces or the crafting of digital environments, my goal is to create systems that resonate with users and leave a lasting impact.
<br><br>
Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to sharing my passion and projects with you.
